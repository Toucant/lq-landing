            <p>$LQ is the Liqwid Governance Token. It can be used to propose and vote on proposals made by any token-holding community members. Users can also delegate their voting power to another address to pool voting power. There has been no pre-sale or ICO of $LQ from the LiqwiDAO, all $LQ will be liquidity mined via user distribution and yield farming or given to the founding team as part of the fair token launch.
