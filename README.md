### Google Analytics Setup

This template uses the [React Google Analytics Module](https://github.com/react-ga/react-ga).

In order to track visitors, you need to set an [environment variable](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/) called `REACT_APP_GA_CODE` storing your [GA Tracking ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7372977).
